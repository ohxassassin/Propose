    Propose day is just a casual day but as a tradition of foreginers the indians also started to celebrate this day but those who doesn't celebrate it dosen't mean that they are not in love propose day is just a way to express love thats it and my love is for u is endless-infinity can't be measured ri8 so for me ur smile is the first priority I look for so lastly I'll say just stay with me baccha and we will end our relationship with a tag of married couples!! I LOVE YOU MERA BACCHA💋💕
